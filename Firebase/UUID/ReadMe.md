## Why Firebase?


Firebase is a service that allows us to create real-time apps without having a native back-end(server). Storing and retrieving of data in real-time is done directly from the browser(front-end), i.e. no back-end services is required to fetch the data.

Whenever we save data in Firebase, it generates a unique identification ID for each object. Sometimes itâ€™s hard to maintain or traverse the data on the basis of these randomly generated IDs, because the only way to access data in Firebase is via URL reference (refObject/books//title) for the particular node. So sometimes we need to store data object with our own custom keys.

## What is UUID (Universal Unique Identifier)?

A UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify some object or entity on the Internet. Depending on the specific mechanisms used, a UUID is either guaranteed to be different or is, at least, extremely likely to be different from any other UUID generated until 3400 A.D
